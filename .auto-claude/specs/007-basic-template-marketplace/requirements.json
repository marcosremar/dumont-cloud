  "task_description": "# Basic Template Marketplace\n\nPre-configured templates for common ML workloads: Jupyter Lab, Stable Diffusion WebUI, ComfyUI, vLLM inference server. One-click deployment with all dependencies configured.\n\n## Rationale\nAddresses pain point of complex GPU environment setup. Vast.ai requires manual CUDA/driver configuration. Templates reduce time-to-first-value from hours to minutes.\n\n## User Stories\n- As an AI artist, I want to deploy Stable Diffusion with one click so that I can start generating images immediately\n- As a developer, I want pre-configured Jupyter Lab so that I don't waste time setting up CUDA and drivers\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] At least 4 official templates available: Jupyter, Stable Diffusion, ComfyUI, vLLM\n- [ ] One-click deployment from dashboard\n- [ ] Templates include optimal GPU recommendations\n- [ ] Each template has documentation and getting-started guide\n- [ ] Templates boot in under 2 minutes\n",
