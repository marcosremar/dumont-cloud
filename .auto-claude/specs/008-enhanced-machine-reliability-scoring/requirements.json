  "task_description": "# Enhanced Machine Reliability Scoring\n\nExpand existing machine blacklist system to include reliability scores visible to users. Show uptime history, interruption rate, and community ratings for each GPU host.\n\n## Rationale\nAddresses Vast.ai pain point of variable machine quality. Builds on existing blacklist feature. Helps users make informed decisions and differentiates from raw marketplaces.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a user selecting a GPU, I want to see machine reliability scores so that I can avoid problematic hosts\n- As a long-running training job owner, I want to prioritize stable machines even at slightly higher cost\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Reliability score (0-100) displayed for each available machine\n- [ ] Score factors: uptime %, interruption rate, user ratings\n- [ ] Historical data visible (last 30 days performance)\n- [ ] Auto-sort by reliability option in machine selection\n- [ ] Machines below threshold auto-excluded unless user opts in\n",
