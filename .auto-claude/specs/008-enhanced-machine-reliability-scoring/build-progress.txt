Project: Enhanced Machine Reliability Scoring
Workspace: /Users/marcos/OrbStack/dumontcloud/home/marcos/projects/dumont-cloud
Started: 2025-12-31 22:30:00 UTC

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Feature enhancement that adds user-visible reliability scoring to existing machine selection. Extends existing blacklist infrastructure with new capabilities.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Created context.json
- Created init.sh
- Phases: 5
- Total subtasks: 18
- Services: backend, frontend, database

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Backend Data Models & Schema): 3 subtasks, no dependencies
- Phase 2 (Backend API Endpoints): 4 subtasks, depends on Phase 1
- Phase 3 (Frontend State Management): 3 subtasks, depends on Phase 2
- Phase 4 (Frontend UI Components): 4 subtasks, depends on Phase 3
- Phase 5 (Integration & Data Population): 5 subtasks, depends on Phase 2 & 4

Services Involved:
- backend (Python/FastAPI): Add reliability data models, calculation service, API endpoints
- frontend (React/Redux): Add reliability UI components, state management, rating interface
- database (PostgreSQL): New tables for user ratings and historical uptime tracking

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups:
  - Phase 1 & 3 could theoretically run in parallel after Phase 2, but sequential execution recommended
- Speedup estimate: Sequential execution recommended due to tight integration dependencies

Key Findings from Codebase Investigation:
- Existing Models: src/models/machine_history.py has MachineStats, MachineBlacklist, OfferStability
- Existing Schema: src/api/v1/schemas/spot/reliability.py has ReliabilityScoreItem
- Existing API: src/api/v1/endpoints/metrics.py has provider reliability endpoints
- Frontend Component: web/src/components/machines/MachineCard.jsx
- Redux State: web/src/store/slices/instancesSlice.js

Implementation Strategy:
1. Extend existing models with UserMachineRating and MachineUptimeHistory
2. Add reliability calculation service (40% uptime, 40% interruption, 20% rating)
3. Create API endpoints for reliability data and rating submission
4. Add Redux state for reliability data and user preferences
5. Update UI with reliability badges, historical charts, and rating interface
6. Run database migrations and populate initial data
7. Test end-to-end flows (view scores, submit ratings, sort/filter)

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 008 --parallel 1

Example:
  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 008 --parallel 1
