=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: NPS and Feedback Collection System
Workspace: dumont-cloud
Started: 2025-12-31 22:30:00

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: This is a new feature implementation adding user satisfaction measurement capabilities to the platform. It requires new UI components, backend APIs, database schema, and integration with existing user workflows. Follows the FEATURE workflow pattern with phases ordered by service dependencies: Database → Backend → Frontend State → Frontend UI → Integration.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 5
- Total subtasks: 13
- Created init.sh
- Created context.json with pattern references

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Database Schema): 2 subtasks, setup type
  * Create SQLAlchemy models for NPS responses, config, user interactions
  * Create SQL migration file for NPS tables

- Phase 2 (Backend API): 4 subtasks, implementation type, depends on phase-1-database
  * Create Pydantic schemas for NPS API
  * Create NPS service with business logic
  * Create FastAPI endpoints for NPS operations
  * Register NPS router in main API router

- Phase 3 (Frontend State Management): 3 subtasks, implementation type, depends on phase-2-backend
  * Create NPS Redux slice with async thunks
  * Register NPS slice in Redux store
  * Create useNPSTrigger custom hook

- Phase 4 (Frontend UI Components): 4 subtasks, implementation type, depends on phase-3-frontend-state
  * Create NPSSurvey modal component
  * Integrate NPSSurvey into App.jsx
  * Create NPSTrends admin dashboard page
  * Add NPSTrends route to application router

- Phase 5 (Integration and Verification): 2 subtasks, integration type, depends on phase-4-frontend-ui
  * End-to-end verification of NPS survey submission flow
  * Apply database migration and verify tables exist

Services Involved:
- backend: FastAPI API endpoints, SQLAlchemy models, business logic
- frontend: React components, Redux state, admin dashboard

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 1
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups: None (sequential execution recommended)
- Speedup estimate: Sequential execution recommended due to tight dependencies between phases

Key Patterns Found:
- Redux Toolkit slices: web/src/store/slices/authSlice.js
- Radix UI Dialog: web/src/components/ui/dialog.jsx
- SQLAlchemy models: src/models/price_history.py, src/models/instance_status.py
- FastAPI routes: src/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py
- Database: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy (src.config.database.Base)
- Migrations: SQL files in ./migrations/ directory

Critical Files Created:
- implementation_plan.json: Complete subtask-based plan with 5 phases, 13 subtasks
- context.json: Updated with pattern references and existing implementations
- init.sh: Startup script for backend and frontend services
- build-progress.txt: This file

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 011 --parallel 1

Example with explicit spec number:
  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 011 --parallel 1

To start development environment manually:
  cd .auto-claude/specs/011-nps-and-feedback-collection-system
  ./init.sh

=== VERIFICATION STRATEGY ===

Risk Level: medium
Test Types Required: unit, integration
Security Scan: Not required
Staging Deployment: Not required

Acceptance Criteria:
- All existing tests pass
- NPS responses stored in database with proper validation
- Rate limiting prevents survey spam
- Admin dashboard displays trends correctly
- No security vulnerabilities in comment storage

Verification Steps:
1. Unit Tests - Backend: cd cli && pytest tests/
2. Unit Tests - Frontend: cd web && npm test (optional, non-blocking)
3. Integration Test: pytest tests/integration/test_nps_flow.py
4. Database Verification: Verify tables exist and queries execute

=== NEXT STEPS ===

1. Run the startup command above to begin implementation
2. Coder agent will start with phase-1-database, subtask-1-1
3. Each subtask will be completed sequentially
4. Verification will run after each subtask completion
5. QA agent will verify all tests pass at the end

=== END SESSION 1 ===

Note: All planning files are gitignored and managed locally by the orchestrator.
      Do NOT commit implementation_plan.json, init.sh, or build-progress.txt to git.
      Only code changes should be committed.
