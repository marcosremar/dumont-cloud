# Add toast exit animations and auto-dismiss progress indicator

## Overview

Enhance Toast component with smooth exit animation (slide up + fade out) and a visual progress bar showing time remaining before auto-dismiss.

## Rationale

Toast notifications only have an entrance animation (toast-in). When dismissed, they instantly disappear which is jarring. Users also have no indication of how long the toast will remain visible, leading to anxiety about missing important messages.
