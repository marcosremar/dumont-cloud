## Completed Commits
- d39c2e5: Exit animation state tracking
- 8424e8a: CSS toast-out animation
- f4295e1: Apply exit animation conditionally
- 385768e: ProgressBar component with integration
- ac8b852: Duration prop flow to ToastItem
- e68fbb8: Hover pause functionality

## Persistent Toast Handling (verified in 3.2)
The following behaviors are confirmed for toasts with duration=0:
1. No progress bar shown (ProgressBar returns null for duration <= 0)
2. Exit animation works correctly (isExiting prop controls animation regardless of duration)
3. Manual dismiss only (auto-dismiss timer skipped for duration <= 0)
