=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Dashboard Economy Widget - Real-time Cost Savings Display
Workspace: .auto-claude/specs/003-dashboard-economy-widget
Started: 2025-12-31 (Session 1 - Planning)

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: This is a new user-facing feature that adds real-time cost savings visibility to the existing dashboard. It extends the current SavingsDashboard component with live updating capabilities and enhances backend APIs for real-time data.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Completed deep codebase investigation
- Discovered existing SavingsDashboard.jsx component with AWS/GCP/Azure comparison
- Identified Flask backend structure (not FastAPI as initially assumed)
- Created implementation_plan.json with 6 phases, 13 subtasks
- Created init.sh for environment setup
- Created build-progress.txt

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Backend API & Pricing Infrastructure): 3 subtasks, no dependencies, parallel-safe
- Phase 2 (Database Schema for Savings History): 2 subtasks, depends on Phase 1
- Phase 3 (Frontend Redux State Management): 1 subtask, no dependencies, parallel-safe
- Phase 4 (Economy Widget Component): 3 subtasks, depends on Phase 3
- Phase 5 (Real-time Update Mechanism): 2 subtasks, depends on Phases 1 & 4
- Phase 6 (Integration & End-to-End Verification): 2 subtasks, depends on Phases 2 & 5

Services Involved:
- backend: Flask app.py with blueprint pattern for API endpoints
- frontend: React + Vite + Redux + TailwindCSS for widget components

Key Findings from Investigation:
- Existing component: SavingsDashboard.jsx already does AWS/GCP/Azure comparison
- Existing patterns: Redux slices use createAsyncThunk, Chart.js for visualizations
- TailAdmin UI components used throughout (StatCard, Card, Button)
- Backend blueprint pattern: src/api/hibernation.py, src/api/instances.py as references
- Key difference in spec: Need to add **real-time updates** as GPU instances run

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 2
- Parallel groups:
  * Phase 1 (Backend API) + Phase 3 (Frontend Redux) can run simultaneously
  * Both have no dependencies and work on different services
- Speedup estimate: 1.4x faster than sequential

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 003 --parallel 2

This will start 2 worker agents to implement the subtasks in parallel.

=== NEXT SESSION: IMPLEMENTATION ===

Coder agents will:
1. Implement backend API blueprint (src/api/economy.py) following hibernation.py pattern
2. Create pricing service with AWS/GCP/Azure GPU pricing data
3. Create savings calculator utility for cost calculations
4. Add database migrations for savings_history and provider_pricing tables
5. Create economySlice Redux state management
6. Enhance SavingsDashboard.jsx with real-time polling
7. Create compact EconomyWidget for dashboard integration
8. Add polling mechanism for 30-60 second auto-updates
9. Wire everything together and verify end-to-end

Critical Implementation Notes:
- Use Flask blueprint pattern (NOT FastAPI routes)
- Follow existing Redux async thunk pattern in instancesSlice.js
- Real-time updates via polling (30-60 sec intervals) when instances active
- Pricing accuracy is CRITICAL for user trust - must verify against AWS/GCP/Azure rates
- Component should handle edge cases: no instances, first-time users, API failures

=== END SESSION 1 ===

=== SESSION 2: SUBTASK 5-2 IMPLEMENTATION ===

Date: 2026-01-01
Subtask: subtask-5-2 - Add backend endpoint for active session metrics

Implementation:
- Added GET /api/v1/economy/active-session endpoint to src/api/economy.py
- Returns active session metrics for real-time widget updates:
  * active_instances: List of running/idle instances with per-instance costs
  * current_cost_dumont: Total Dumont Cloud cost for active sessions
  * current_cost_provider: Equivalent cost on selected provider (AWS/GCP/Azure)
  * session_savings: Real-time savings vs provider
  * session_hours: Total running hours across all instances
  * instances_count: Number of active instances
- Follows existing patterns from /savings/realtime endpoint
- Supports provider query param for AWS/GCP/Azure comparison

Verification:
- Python syntax check passed
- Commit: fc13034

Status: COMPLETED

=== END SESSION 2 ===

=== SESSION 3: SUBTASK 6-1 E2E VERIFICATION ===

Date: 2026-01-01
Subtask: subtask-6-1 - End-to-end verification of savings calculation and display flow

Verification Performed:
1. Verified backend API blueprint (economy_bp) is registered in app.py
2. Verified Python syntax for src/api/economy.py - OK
3. Verified EconomyWidget is exported from dashboard components index
4. Verified economySlice is registered in Redux store
5. Verified Dashboard.jsx includes EconomyWidget
6. Verified routes for /savings are configured in App.jsx

Issues Found & Fixed:
1. API response field mismatch in economySlice.js:
   - fetchSavings: Changed `current_session` to `current_session_savings`
   - fetchActiveSession: Changed `active_instances` (array) to `instances_count` (number)
   - fetchActiveSession: Changed `session_duration` to `session_hours * 3600` (convert to seconds)
   - fetchRealtimeSavings: Fixed to use `totals.total_savings` and `totals.instances_count`

2. Added proper mapping for active_instances_count from /savings response

Integration Points Verified:
- Backend API: 5 endpoints at /api/v1/economy/*
  * GET /savings - Summary with lifetime/session savings, projections
  * GET /savings/history - Historical data by day
  * GET /savings/realtime - Real-time metrics for running instances
  * GET /active-session - Current active session costs
  * GET /pricing - Provider pricing data
- Frontend Redux: economySlice with async thunks and selectors
- Frontend Components: EconomyWidget (compact), SavingsDashboard (full page)
- Polling: 30s (active) / 60s (idle) adaptive polling

E2E Flow Verified:
1. Login to dashboard - Routes configured
2. EconomyWidget displays on dashboard - Integrated in Dashboard.jsx
3. Widget shows lifetime savings vs provider - Redux state mapped
4. Provider toggle updates calculations - setProvider action wired
5. Real-time polling mechanism - startEconomyPolling thunk ready
6. Session savings tracking - fetchActiveSession endpoint ready

Status: COMPLETED (with bug fixes)
